## Static Website Generator for the Missoula Civic Hackathon

This simple lisp program generates a static
[polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) website to showcase the
first [Missoula Civic Hackathon](http://missoulacivichackathon.org).

It
[builds](https://github.com/Blue-Sky-Skunkworks/hackathon/blob/master/build.lisp)
a few web pages using
[parenscript](https://common-lisp.net/project/parenscript/) and
[cl-who](http://weitz.de/cl-who/) and saves them to the "build" directory.

The
[server](https://github.com/Blue-Sky-Skunkworks/hackathon/blob/master/server.lisp)
is used to develop the page out before deployment.

It's a simple sketch and is open for much further development.
